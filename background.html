<!--
    So the way that this works is a little weird.
    I have several scripts that I want to run in the background, and they need to be able to see each other.
    It turns out that the scripts need to run in the context of a page in order to be visible to each other, so this background.html page only exists to include all the necessary start-up scripts like setting the default options and opening the options page.
    Each of these scripts gets run automatically just by being included here.
